== Preparing  your coolstore enviornment 

==== Lets start by verfiying are cool store is up and running. 

Lets attempt to access the CoolStore application. Via your web browser
----
http://web-<project-id>.{{ COOLSTORE_ROUTE_HOST }}/#/
----

[TIP]
====
To get <project-id> use with in your codeready workspace terminal
----
oc project 
----
====

Lets run the following script to update the codebase in this project.
----
curl -OL whatever
----

Delete the older spring boot build in the project
----
$ oc delete bc/catalog-s2i
buildconfig.build.openshift.io "catalog-s2i" deleted
----

We will now build the catalog spring boot project
image:{% image_path prepare-build.png %}[CodeReady Build, 400]

Now deploy the project using fabric8
image:{% image_path prepare-fabric8.png %}[CodeReady  Fabric8, 400]

Lets attempt to access the catalog API. Via your web browser
----
http://{{ CATALOG_ROUTE_HOST }}
----

Delete the older inventory thorntail build in the project
----
$ oc delete bc/inventory-s2i
buildconfig.build.openshift.io "inventory-s2i" deleted
----

We will now build the inventory thorntail project
image:{% image_path prepare-build.png %}[CodeReady Build, 400]

Now deploy the project using fabric8
image:{% image_path prepare-fabric8.png %}[CodeReady  Fabric8, 400]

Lets attempt to access the inventory API. Via your web browser
----
http://{{ INVENTORY_ROUTE_HOST }}
----

Delete the older gateway-vertx build in the project
----
oc delete bc/gateway-s2i
----

We will now build the gateway-vertx project
image:{% image_path prepare-build.png %}[CodeReady Build, 400]

Now deploy the project using fabric8
image:{% image_path prepare-fabric8.png %}[CodeReady  Fabric8, 400]

Lets attempt to access the inventory API. Via your web browser
----
http://{{ API_GATEWAY_ROUTE_HOST }}
----

Well done! You are ready for the next lab.
