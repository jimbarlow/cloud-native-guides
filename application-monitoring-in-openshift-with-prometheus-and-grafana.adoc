== Application monitoring in OpenShift with Prometheus and Grafana
*20 MINUTE EXERCISE*

== What is Prometheus and Grafana
**Prometheus** is  an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. Which was originally built at SoundCloud. Since its beginnings in 2012
 many companies and organizations have started using Prometheus. As a result Prometheus is now a standalone open-source project and it is maintained
 independently of any company. Prometheus is also built into https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/prometheus_cluster_monitoring.html[OpenShift] it is used to monitor the overall infrastructure of OpenShift for operators.

**Alert Manager** is a function  in prometheus that takes in alerts, aggregates them into groups, de-duplicates,  silences, throttles, and then sends out notifications to email, Pagerduty, Slack etc.
Using this you can define your own alerts on the metrics collected by Prometheus so you can be notified on anything that is important.

*Prometheus Configuration*
[square]
*  `global` - the global section in a Prometheus file controls the the servers global configuration.
* `rule_files` - The rule_files section specifies the location of any rules we want Prometheus server to load.
* `scrape_configs` -  The scrape_configs controls what Prometheus monitors. It does this by specifying  a set of targets and parameters describing how to scrape them.
In the general case, one scrape configuration specifies a single job. Targets may be statically configured via the static_configs parameter or dynamically discovered using one of the supported service-discovery mechanisms.

*Example Configuration*
----
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

rule_files:
  # - "first.rules"
  # - "second.rules"

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: prometheus
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
----

**Grafana** is an open-source general purpose dashboard and graph composer. Grafana allows you to query visualize, alert on and understand different metrics.
Grafana supports many sources for metric and it does not mater where the metrics are stored. Users  can create, explore and share dashboards with other people on there team.
 Grafana  is good for  fostering a data-driven  culture.

In the lab below  we will take the inventory service from the coolstore and add metrics to it. We will take those metrics and send them to Prometheus. Prometheus will then forward the metrics to
grafana where we can visualize and graph the metrics that we create.

== Inventory Thorntail Lab
Add the following to your pom.xml
----
 <dependency>
   <groupId>io.thorntail</groupId>
   <artifactId>microprofile</artifactId>
 </dependency>
----

Import the following to your labs/inventory-thorntail/src/main/java/com/redhat/cloudnative/inventory/InventoryResource.java file to line 7-8
----
import org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.annotation.Counted;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics.annotation.Timed;
----


Add the the following code to lines 19-26
`@Counted` is used to keep track of how many times this method was invoked
`@Timed` is used to keep track of how long the invocations took
----
@Counted(
      name = "inventory-count",
      absolute = true,
      monotonic = true,
      displayName = "getAvailability",
      description = "Metrics to show how many times getAvailability method was called.",
      tags = {"available=true"})
@Timed(name = "inventory-time", absolute = true)
----

Delete the older inventory thorntail build in the project
----
$ oc delete bc/inventory-s2i
buildconfig.build.openshift.io "inventory-s2i" deleted
----

Click on the inventory-thorntail
We will now build the inventory thorntail project

Now deploy the project using fabric8

*Testing  Prometheus dashboard*  
Get inventory endpoint  
----
INVENTORY_ROUTE_HOST=$(oc get routes | grep inventory  | awk '{print $2}')
echo  $INVENTORY_ROUTE_HOST
----

*Verify the metrics endpoint exists*
---- 
$ curl http://${INVENTORY_ROUTE_HOST}/metrics
----


*Run a load test against the endpoint below.*
----
siege -c 3 -t 90 -d 3 http://${INVENTORY_ROUTE_HOST}/api/inventory/329299
----

*Navigate to the prometheus dashboard and search for*
----
{{PROMETHEUS_ROUTE_HOST}}
----

Search for `application:inventory_time_seconds_count`
Under console note the name of your pod and the information it is giving you.
Under Graph not you pod name and compare it to others seen on the graph.

Explore different queries using `inventory` as the key word.

*Navigate to the Grafana dashboard* +
